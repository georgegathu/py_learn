#PYTHON STRING
"""
    A string is a sequence of characters that can be a combination of 
    letters, numbers, and special characters.
    It can be declared by using single quotes, double quotes, or even triple quotes.
    These quotes are not a part of a string, they define only starting and ending of the string
    Strings are immutable, i.e., they cannot be changed.
    Each element of the string can be accessed using indexing or slicing operations.
