# Variable Names
"""
You can name a variable anything as long as it obeys the following 
three rules:
 •	It can be only one word with no spaces.
 •	It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character.
 •	It can’t begin with a number.
 Variables are case sensitive: car, Car, CAR and CaR are four different variables.
