Operator Meaning

    >= Greater than or equal to

#THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE == AND = OPERATORS
"""
-You might have noticed that the == operator (equal to) has two equal signs,
while the = operator (assignment) has just one equal sign. It’s easy to confuse
these two operators with each other. Just remember these points:
• The == operator (equal to) asks whether two values are the same as
each other.
• The = operator (assignment) puts the value on the right into the variable
on the left.
-To help remember which is which, notice that the == operator (equal to)
consists of two characters, just like the != operator (not equal to) consists of
two characters.
